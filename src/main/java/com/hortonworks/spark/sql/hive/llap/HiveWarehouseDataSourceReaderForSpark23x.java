/**
 * A DataReader Implementation with loose filter pushdown rules. Disables projection pruning entirely.
 * Developed mainly due to issues where parent and child dataframes share Reader instance in spark 2.3.x
 * See https://hortonworks.jira.com/browse/BUG-118876 and https://hortonworks.jira.com/browse/BUG-121727 for more details.
 * <p>
 * In case of parent child relationship in dataframes, this performs well if some meaningful .filter() is specified in parent dataframe.
 * The stricter the definition of .filter() in parent DF, the better it will perform for both parent and child dataframes.
 * <p>
 * It takes filters from all the dataframes, joins them using 'OR' and pushes all of them to hive and hence fetches a resultset
 * inclusive of all the filters. Later more filtering is done at spark side depending on what specific filter was specified
 * on a particular dataframe.
 * This implementation is not thread safe.
 * Since this is runs in spark driver, it is assumed that spark internally never invokes
 * this code in multiple threads for the same instance of HiveWarehouseDataSourceReaderForSpark23x.
