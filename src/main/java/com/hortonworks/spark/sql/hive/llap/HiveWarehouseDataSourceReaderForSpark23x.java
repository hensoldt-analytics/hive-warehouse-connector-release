/**
 * A DataReader Implementation which only supports pushdowns. Disables projection pruning entirely.
 * Developed mainly due to issues where parent and child dataframes share Reader instance in spark 2.3.x
 * See https://hortonworks.jira.com/browse/BUG-118876 and https://hortonworks.jira.com/browse/BUG-121727 for more details.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation is not thread safe.
 * Since this is runs in spark driver, it is assumed that spark internally never invokes
 * this code in multiple threads for the same instance of HiveWarehouseDataSourceReaderForSpark23x.
